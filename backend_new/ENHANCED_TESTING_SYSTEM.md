- **Service Status**: Assessment service configuration and availability
- **Test Results**: Detailed results of each test component
- **Issues Tracking**: Categorized issues with severity levels
- **Recommendations**: Automated suggestions for improvements
- **Timestamps**: Execution time and creation timestamps

### **2. Enhanced Quick Test Script**
**File**: `backend_new/scripts/quickTest.js`

**New Capabilities**:
- ✅ **Comprehensive Issue Detection**: Automatically identifies system problems
- ✅ **Severity Classification**: Critical, High, Medium, Low severity levels
- ✅ **Automated Recommendations**: Provides actionable suggestions
- ✅ **Database Storage**: Saves all test results for historical tracking
- ✅ **Status Calculation**: Determines overall test status (passed/warning/failed)
- ✅ **Performance Metrics**: Tracks execution times and processing speeds

### **3. Test Results Viewer**
**File**: `backend_new/scripts/viewTestResults.js`

**Viewing Options**:
- **Recent Results**: View latest test executions
- **Summary**: Overall statistics and success rates
- **Failed Tests**: Focus on problematic test runs
- **Detailed Stats**: Performance metrics and common issues
- **Cleanup**: Remove old test results to manage storage

## Usage Commands:

### **Running Tests**:
```bash

- **⚠️ WARNING**: Tests completed but high-priority issues found
- **❌ FAILED**: Critical issues or test execution failures

### **Issue Severity Levels**:
- **🚨 CRITICAL**: System-breaking issues requiring immediate attention
- **⚠️ HIGH**: Important issues that should be addressed soon
- **📋 MEDIUM**: Issues that may impact functionality
- **ℹ️ LOW**: Minor issues or recommendations for improvement

### **Tracked Metrics**:
```javascript
{
  test_name: 'quick_test',
  status: 'passed|warning|failed',
  execution_time_ms: 1250,
  data_counts: {
    users: 45,
    jobs: 23,
    applications: 67,
    assessments: 34,
    ai_assessments: 28
  },
  service_status: {
    assessment_service_status: 'active',
    primary_method: 'rule-based',
    openai_available: false,
    fallback_enabled: true
  },
  issues_found: [
    {
      type: 'no_openai_key',
      severity: 'medium',
      description: 'OpenAI API key not configured',
      recommendation: 'Add OPENAI_API_KEY for enhanced AI features'
    }
  ]
}
```

## Automated Issue Detection:

### **System Health Checks**:
- **Database Connectivity**: MongoDB connection status
- **Data Availability**: Presence of users, jobs, skills, questions
- **Service Configuration**: Assessment service setup and availability
- **API Dependencies**: OpenAI and other external service availability
- **Test Data**: Availability of data for comprehensive testing

### **Common Issues Detected**:

#### **Critical Issues**:
- Database connection failures
- Assessment service not active
- Test execution failures

#### **High Priority Issues**:
- No assessment questions available
- AI assessment test failures
- Missing critical data

#### **Medium Priority Issues**:
- OpenAI configured but not available
- No jobs with assessment requirements
- Limited test data

#### **Low Priority Issues**:
- No applications for testing
- Recommendations for system improvements

## Database Collections:

### **TestResult Collection**:
```javascript
// Indexes for efficient querying
{ test_name: 1, executed_at: -1 }
{ status: 1, executed_at: -1 }

// Sample document
{
  _id: ObjectId("..."),
  test_name: "quick_test",
  test_version: "2.0",
  status: "passed",
  execution_time_ms: 1250,
  environment: {
    node_env: "development",
    mongodb_connected: true,
    openai_available: false,
    assessment_method: "rule-based"
  },
  data_counts: { ... },
  service_status: { ... },
  test_results: { ... },
  issues_found: [ ... ],
  recommendations: [ ... ],
  executed_at: ISODate("2024-01-15T10:30:00Z"),
  createdAt: ISODate("2024-01-15T10:30:00Z"),
  updatedAt: ISODate("2024-01-15T10:30:00Z")
