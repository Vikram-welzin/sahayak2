static async notifyJobApplication(employerId, application) {
  const title = `New Job Application: ${application.job_id.title}`;
  const message = `${application.seeker_id.name} has applied for your job "${application.job_id.title}". Review their profile and consider for hiring.`;
  // ... notification creation
}
```

```javascript
static async notifyAssessmentStarted(employerId, assessment) {
  const title = `Assessment Started: ${assessment.skill_id.name}`;
  const message = `${assessment.user_id.name} has started the ${assessment.skill_id.name} assessment for ${assessment.job_id.title}.`;
  // ... notification creation
}
```

#### **C. Assessment Completed Notification:**

static async notifyAssessmentCompleted(employerId, assessment) {
  const passed = assessment.percentage >= 70;
  const title = `Assessment ${passed ? 'Completed' : 'Failed'}: ${assessment.skill_id.name}`;
  const message = `${assessment.user_id.name} has completed the ${assessment.skill_id.name} assessment with ${assessment.percentage}% score.`;
